# Quantum compiler and pulse generation scheme    
The quantum compiler is responsible for converting a quantum algorithm represented as a string of gates operated on multiple qubits to a sequence of amplitude and phase modulated waveforms played on an arbitrary waveform generator. Spin qubits

                                 (1)x(1);(2)x(2);  


## Gate species and phase/amplitude relations      

## Calibration parameters and protocols   


## Channel groupings

## Phase increments and command table formulation    


#Worked example for a quantum circuit
To convey a comprehensive understanding of the quantum compiler's inner-workings, let's attempt to generate the pulse sequences for the following quantum algorithm on a three-qubit array.
